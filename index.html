    <p><b>Web Development</b> is the <em>act of building, creating and maintaining websites.</em> The field encompasses a broad range of tasks including everything from coding, to technical design, to the performance of a website or application running on the internet. Web development consists of front-end and back-end components.
        <br>
        <i>Web development</i> is responsible for <strong>creating the sites and applications</strong> we use through a web browser in our day-to-day lives. Web developers, often working in teams or alongside other tech professionals like data scientists, UX designers and product managers, use specialized techniques and a thorough knowledge of one or more programming languages to create a foundation for where the websiteâ€™s database will live, known as a back-end.

    <pre>FRONT-END WEB DEVELOPMENT VS. BACK-END WEB DEVELOPMENT - 

        Front-end development consists of the <mark>user interface (UI)</mark> and the look and feel of the website or application.
        Front-end development is responsible for the aspects of a website that users see and interact with: the user interface (UI).
        Front-end developers are well-versed in HTML, CSS and JavaScript, often working closely with design and UX teams to capture both the intended look and feel of the site, while also creating a quality user experience across multiple device types.
        Back-end development consists of the databases, logic, APIs, servers and everything else that powers the website behind the scenes.
        Back-end development is responsible for all the aspects of a website that users do not see.
        This is also known as <ins>server-side development</ins> because back-end developers focus primarily on the behind-the-scenes logic, APIs and database interactions that power the site.
